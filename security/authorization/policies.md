  # Custom Policy-Based Authorization

Underneath the covers the [role authorization](roles.md#security-authorization-role-based.md) and [claims authorization](claims.md#security-authorization-claims-based.md) make use of a requirement, a handler for the requirement and a pre-configured policy. These building blocks allow you to express authorization evaluations in code, allowing for a richer, reusable, and easily testable authorization structure.

An authorization policy is made up of one or more requirements and registered at application startup as part of the Authorization service configuration, in `ConfigureServices` in the *Startup.cs* file.

<!-- literal_block {"ids": [], "names": [], "highlight_args": {}, "backrefs": [], "dupnames": [], "linenos": false, "classes": [], "xml:space": "preserve", "language": "c#"} -->

````c#

   public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
   {
       services.AddMvc();

       services.AddAuthorization(options =>
       {
           options.AddPolicy("Over21",
                             policy => policy.Requirements.Add(new MinimumAgeRequirement(21)));
       }
   });
   ````

Here you can see an "Over21" policy is created with a single requirement, that of a minimum age, which is passed as a parameter to the requirement.

Policies are applied using the `Authorize` attribute by specifying the policy name, for example;

<!-- literal_block {"ids": [], "names": [], "highlight_args": {}, "backrefs": [], "dupnames": [], "linenos": false, "classes": [], "xml:space": "preserve", "language": "c#"} -->

````c#

   [Authorize(Policy="Over21")]
   public class AlcoholPurchaseRequirementsController : Controller
   {
       public ActionResult Login()
       {
       }

       public ActionResult Logout()
       {
       }
   }
   ````

  ## Requirements

An authorization requirement is a collection of data parameters that a policy can use to evaluate the current user principal. In our Minimum Age policy the requirement we have a single parameter, the minimum age. A requirement must implement `IAuthorizationRequirement`. This is an empty, marker interface. A parameterized minimum age requirement might be implemented as follows;

<!-- literal_block {"ids": [], "names": [], "highlight_args": {}, "backrefs": [], "dupnames": [], "linenos": false, "classes": [], "xml:space": "preserve", "language": "c#"} -->

````c#

   public class MinimumAgeRequirement : IAuthorizationRequirement
   {
       public MinimumAgeRequirement(int age)
       {
           MinimumAge = age;
       }

       protected int MinimumAge { get; set; }
   }
   ````

A requirement doesn't need to have data or properties.

  ## Authorization Handlers

An authorization handler is responsible for the evaluation of any properties of a requirement. The  authorization handler must evaluate them against a provided `AuthorizationContext` to decide if authorization is allowed. A requirement can have [multiple handlers](xref:security/authorization/policies#security-authorization-policies-based-multiple-handlers). Handlers must inherit `AuthorizationHandler<T>` where T is the requirement it handles.

<a name=security-authorization-handler-example></a>

The minimum age handler might look like this:

<!-- literal_block {"ids": [], "names": [], "highlight_args": {}, "backrefs": [], "dupnames": [], "linenos": false, "classes": [], "xml:space": "preserve", "language": "c#"} -->

````c#

   public class MinimumAgeHandler : AuthorizationHandler<MinimumAgeRequirement>
   {
       protected override Task HandleRequirementAsync(AuthorizationContext context, MinimumAgeRequirement requirement)
       {
           if (!context.User.HasClaim(c => c.Type == ClaimTypes.DateOfBirth &&
                                      c.Issuer == "http://contoso.com"))
           {
               // .NET 4.x -> return Task.FromResult(0);
               return Task.CompletedTask;
           }

           var dateOfBirth = Convert.ToDateTime(context.User.FindFirst(
               c => c.Type == ClaimTypes.DateOfBirth && c.Issuer == "http://contoso.com").Value);

           int calculatedAge = DateTime.Today.Year - dateOfBirth.Year;
           if (dateOfBirth > DateTime.Today.AddYears(-calculatedAge))
           {
               calculatedAge--;
           }

           if (calculatedAge >= requirement.MinimumAge)
           {
               context.Succeed(requirement);
           }
           return Task.CompletedTask;
       }
   }
   ````

In the code above we first look to see if the current user principal has a date of birth claim which has been issued by an Issuer we know and trust. If the claim is missing we can't authorize so we return. If we have a claim, we figure out how old the user is, and if they meet the minimum age passed in by the requirement then authorization has been successful. Once authorization is successful we call `context.Succeed()` passing in the requirement that has been successful as a parameter.

<a name=security-authorization-policies-based-handler-registration></a>

Handlers must be registered in the services collection during configuration, for example;

<!-- literal_block {"ids": [], "names": [], "highlight_args": {}, "backrefs": [], "dupnames": [], "linenos": false, "classes": [], "xml:space": "preserve", "language": "c#"} -->

````c#

   public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
   {
       services.AddMvc();

       services.AddAuthorization(options =>
       {
           options.AddPolicy("Over21",
                             policy => policy.Requirements.Add(new MinimumAgeRequirement(21)));
       });

       services.AddSingleton<IAuthorizationHandler, MinimumAgeHandler>();
   }
   ````

Each handler is added to the services collection by using `services.AddSingleton<IAuthorizationHandler, YourHandlerClass>();` passing in your handler class.

  ## What should a handler return?

You can see in our [handler example](xref:security/authorization/policies#security-authorization-handler-example) that the `Handle()` method has no return value, so how do we indicate success or failure?

* A handler indicates success by calling `context.Succeed(IAuthorizationRequirement requirement)`, passing the requirement that has been successfully validated.

* A handler does not need to handle failures generally, as other handlers for the same requirement may succeed.

* To guarantee failure even if other handlers for a requirement succeed, call `context.Fail`.

Regardless of what you call inside your handler all handlers for a requirement will be called when a policy requires the requirement. This allows requirements to have side effects, such as logging, which will always take place even if `context.Fail()` has been called in another handler.

<a name=security-authorization-policies-based-multiple-handlers></a>

  ## Why would I want multiple handlers for a requirement?

In cases where you want evaluation to be on an **OR** basis you implement multiple handlers for a single requirement. For example, Microsoft has doors which only open with key cards. If you leave your key card at home the receptionist prints a temporary sticker and opens the door for you. In this scenario you'd have a single requirement, *EnterBuilding*, but multiple handlers, each one examining a single requirement.

<!-- literal_block {"ids": [], "names": [], "highlight_args": {}, "backrefs": [], "dupnames": [], "linenos": false, "classes": [], "xml:space": "preserve", "language": "c#"} -->

````c#

   public class EnterBuildingRequirement : IAuthorizationRequirement
   {
   }

   public class BadgeEntryHandler : AuthorizationHandler<EnterBuildingRequirement>
   {
       protected override Task HandleRequirementAsync(AuthorizationHandlerContext context, EnterBuildingRequirement requirement)
       {
           if (context.User.HasClaim(c => c.Type == ClaimTypes.BadgeId &&
                                          c.Issuer == "http://microsoftsecurity"))
           {
               context.Succeed(requirement);
           }
           return Task.CompletedTask;
       }
   }

   public class HasTemporaryStickerHandler : AuthorizationHandler<EnterBuildingRequirement>
   {
       protected override Task HandleRequirementAsync(AuthorizationHandlerContext context, EnterBuildingRequirement requirement)
       {
           if (context.User.HasClaim(c => c.Type == ClaimTypes.TemporaryBadgeId &&
                                          c.Issuer == "https://microsoftsecurity"))
           {
               // We'd also check the expiration date on the sticker.
               context.Succeed(requirement);
           }
           return Task.CompletedTask;
       }
   }
   ````

Now, assuming both handlers are [registered](xref:security/authorization/policies#security-authorization-policies-based-handler-registration) when a policy evaluates the `EnterBuildingRequirement` if either handler succeeds the policy evaluation will succeed.

  ## Using a func to fufill a policy

There may be occasions where fufilling a policy is simple to express in code. It is possible to simply supply a `Func<AuthorizationHandlerContext, bool>` when configuring your policy with the `RequireAssertion` policy builder.

For example the previous `BadgeEntryHandler` could be rewritten as follows;

<!-- literal_block {"ids": [], "names": [], "highlight_args": {}, "backrefs": [], "dupnames": [], "linenos": false, "classes": [], "xml:space": "preserve", "language": "c#"} -->

````c#

   services.AddAuthorization(options =>
       {
           options.AddPolicy("BadgeEntry",
                             policy => policy.RequireAssertion(context =>
                                     context.User.HasClaim(c =>
                                        (c.Type == ClaimTypes.BadgeId ||
                                         c.Type == ClaimTypes.TemporaryBadgeId)
                                         && c.Issuer == "https://microsoftsecurity"));
                             }));
       }
    }
   ````

  ## Accessing MVC Request Context In Handlers

The `Handle` method you must implement in an authorization handler has two parameters, an `AuthorizationContext` and the `Requirement` you are handling. Frameworks such as MVC or Jabbr are free to add any object to the `Resource` property on the `AuthorizationContext` to pass through extra information.

For example MVC passes an instance of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Filters.AuthorizationFilterContext` in the resource property which is used to access HttpContext, RouteData and everything else MVC provides.

The use of the `Resource` property is framework specific. Using information in the `Resource` property will limit your authorization policies to particular frameworks. You should cast the `Resource` property using the `as` keyword, and then check the cast has succeed to ensure your code doesn't crash with `InvalidCastExceptions` when run on other frameworks;

<!-- literal_block {"ids": [], "names": [], "highlight_args": {}, "backrefs": [], "dupnames": [], "linenos": false, "classes": [], "xml:space": "preserve", "language": "c#"} -->

````c#

   var mvcContext = context.Resource as Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Filters.AuthorizationFilterContext;

   if (mvcContext != null)
   {
       // Examine MVC specific things like routing data.
   }
