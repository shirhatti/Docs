  # Servicing

By [Sourabh Shirhatti](https://twitter.com/sshirhatti), [Daniel Roth](https://github.com/danroth27)

[.NET Core](https://microsoft.com/net/core) supports servicing of runtime components and packages to patch any vulnerabilities when they are discovered. For information on how to enable servicing for applications in a hosted environment please refer to the [.NET Core Servicing](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/articles/core/versions/servicing) documentation.
